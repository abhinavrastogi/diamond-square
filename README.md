## Diamond Square Terrain Generation

This is a simple implementation of the [Diamond Square Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond-square_algorithm) in vanilla JS ES5. This algo is used to generate semi-realistic terrain heightmaps. 

Quoting Wiki for definition:

> The diamond-square algorithm is a method for generating heightmaps for computer graphics. It is a slightly better algorithm than the three-dimensional implementation of the midpoint displacement algorithm which produces two-dimensional landscapes. It is also known as the random midpoint displacement fractal, the cloud fractal or the plasma fractal, because of the plasma effect produced when applied.
